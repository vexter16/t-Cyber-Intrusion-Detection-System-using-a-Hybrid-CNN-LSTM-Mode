# Intelligent Cyber Intrusion Detection System using Hybrid CNN-LSTM



## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) leveraging a hybrid deep learning model. The system combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in network traffic data. The primary goal is to accurately detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, distinguishing them from normal network activity.

The system is trained and evaluated on the KDD Cup '99 dataset (specifically, KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+). To showcase its capabilities, an interactive web-based dashboard built with Streamlit is included, allowing users to upload KDD-like network data, receive predictions, and visualize simulated real-time threat analytics.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Hybrid Deep Learning Model:** CNN-LSTM architecture for robust pattern recognition.
*   **DoS Attack Detection:** Specialized in identifying Denial of Service attacks.
*   **KDD Dataset:** Utilizes the widely recognized KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ datasets.
*   **Comprehensive Preprocessing:** Includes One-Hot Encoding, Standardization, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for:
    *   Uploading KDD-like CSV data.
    *   Simulated real-time processing of data in chunks.
    *   Dynamic visualization of predictions, attack ratios, and traffic patterns.
    *   Downloadable prediction logs.
*   **Modular Code:** Separated scripts for model training/artifact generation and the Streamlit dashboard application.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the CNN-LSTM model.
    *   Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler), feature selection (RFE), and evaluation metrics.
    *   Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   NumPy: For numerical operations.
*   **Dashboard:**
    *   Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.
    *   Plotly: For generating interactive charts and gauges.
*   **Utilities:**
    *   Joblib: For saving/loading Scikit-learn objects (scaler, OHE).
    *   JSON: For saving/loading feature lists and configurations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vexter16/t-Cyber-Intrusion-Detection-System-using-a-Hybrid-CNN-LSTM-Mode.git
    cd t-Cyber-Intrusion-Detection-System-using-a-Hybrid-CNN-LSTM-Mode
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all the necessary Dependencies

4.  **Download KDD Dataset (if not included):**
    This project uses the KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ datasets. You can typically find them by searching for "NSL-KDD dataset download."
    *   Place `KDDTrain+.txt` and `KDDTest+.txt` in a designated directory (e.g., a `dataset/` folder or update paths in the training script).
    *   The project uses `KDDTrain+.txt` for model training and `KDDTest+.txt` for evaluation/dashboard testing.

5.  **Generate Model Artifacts:**
    *   Run the training script:
        ```bash
        
         training.ipynb
        # If it's a Jupyter Notebook, open and run all cells.
        ```
    *   This will train the model and save the necessary `.keras`, `.pkl`, and `.json` files 

## üöÄ Running the Application

1.  **Ensure Artifacts are Present:** Verify that all required model artifacts  have been generated by the training script and are accessible to `app.py`. Update paths in `app.py` if needed.

2.  **Run the Streamlit Dashboard:**
    Navigate to the directory containing `app.py` (e.g., `src/`) and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will open in your default web browser.

3.  **Using the Dashboard:**
    *   Upload a KDD-like CSV file using the sidebar. A sample input file (`sample_kdd_test_input.csv`) might be provided in the `data/` directory. The CSV should ideally be headerless and contain 41 features.
    *   Adjust "Data Chunk Size" and "Refresh Interval" for the simulation.
    *   Click "Start/Resume Simulation" to begin processing the data.
    *   Observe the dynamic metrics, charts, and prediction log.
